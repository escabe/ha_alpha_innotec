# Alpha Innotec Heating/Cooling system Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration for Alpha Innotec heating/cooling systems.

This integration is meant entirely for my own use with the exact system as found in my home. It is not entirely configurable and certain options/values are hardcoded. Feel free to use it to build your *own custom integration* for your own system. Probably not that useful out-of-the-box unless your system happens to be the exact same as mine.
